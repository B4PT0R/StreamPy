# To Do

-Test thoroughly if every streamlit widget/command/syntax work properly and seamlessly.
Most basic widgets/commands/syntaxes already work, but there may be issues to adress with some special ones.

-Adress the "missing/double widget bug" appearing in some cases (without using experimental_rerun would be neat!).

-Implement automatic key attribution for compatible widgets in case the user doesn't provide any (avoid weird widget's behavior)
-->Done

-Improve the editor functionalities (open several files in tabs)

-Improve robustness via adequate exception handling

-Implement the possibility to choose if past input cells are visible or not.
-->Done
